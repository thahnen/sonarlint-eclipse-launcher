# SonarLint for Eclipse: Development launcher

This repository contains common exported launchers for developing SonarLint for Eclipse.

## Ant scripts

Some Ant scripts are used for better integration of Maven projects into Eclipse. This is due Maven creating a file
named **_remote.repositories** per artifact downloaded inside the local repository. Running these scripts will remove
friction when (re-)loading target platforms

- *sonarlint-core-osgi.xml* used for pre-Sloop development, having one OSGi bundle for all of SonarLint Core
- *sonarlint-rpc-protocol.xml* used for development, containing only the RPC protocol definition
- *sonarlint-rpc-java-client.xml* used for development, containing only the RPC client (Java based IDEs)
- *sonarlint-java-client-utils.xml* used for development, containing only utilities (Java based IDEs)
- *sonarlint-java-client-legacy.xml* used for development, containing legacy logic not yet moved (Java based IDEs)

There is one Ant script used for SonarLint to pick up Eclipse plug-in test projects as they don't necessarily follow
the Maven project structure and when the classpath files are generated by Maven/Tycho the *test* property is not always
set correctly:

- *sonarlint-test-classpath.xml* used so SonarLint issues are only raised for non-production rules on test source code


## TODOs:

There are still some things left to do:

- unify the Ant scripts for the target platform definition with one single library
- add Ant script for testing [THIS](https://xtranet-sonarsource.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SL/pages/2875162997/HOWTO+Update+SLCORE+in+SLE)
- add Ant script for checking protobuf version consistency between SLE / SLCORE
